## Abstract
We give an algorithm A which assigns probabilities to logical sentences. For any simple infinite sequence of sentences whose truth-values appear indistinguishable from a biased coin that outputs true with probability p, we have that the sequence of probabilities that A assigns to these sentences converges to p.
